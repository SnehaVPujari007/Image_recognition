# Cats vs. Dogs Image Recognition

This project focuses on building an image recognition model to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Preprocess image data for training and validation.
- Build and train a CNN model to differentiate between cats and dogs.
- Evaluate the model's performance and test it with new images.

---

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Rescaling and augmenting images to enhance model training.
- **CNN Architecture:** A multi-layered model designed for image classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation:** Visualizations of accuracy and loss for both training and validation phases.
- **Prediction Capability:** Ability to classify new, unseen images as either "Cat" or "Dog."

---
Each subfolder should contain respective images of cats and dogs. Ensure the dataset is balanced and includes sufficient images for effective training and validation.

## Steps to Build the Model

1. **Load and Preprocess Data:**
   - The training images are augmented to make the model more robust to variations.
   - Validation images are rescaled for consistency.

2. **Build the CNN Model:**
   - The model consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Train the Model:**
   - The model is trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer for 15 epochs.

4. **Evaluate Performance:**
   - Accuracy and loss metrics are visualized to analyze model performance.

5. **Save and Test:**
   - Save the trained model and test it with new images.

## Results

- The model achieves high accuracy in classifying cats and dogs.
- Training and validation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over epochs.
- The final model can reliably predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
